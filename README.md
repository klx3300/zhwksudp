### What's this

This is a simple and naive implementation of reliable data transport through UDP.

features: crc check, timeout resend, sliding-window

and this doesn't support multiple concurrent connections.

but I think it's very easy to modify the prot.c to achieve this by wrapping a new structure of socket.

// again makefile is generated by `zhwkmk` and network&concurrent support by `zhwkre`.



### TEST

```shell
$ zhwkmk # if you have
$ make server
$ make client
$ ./server &
$ ./client
```
